## **Summary**

Building a browser-based idle RPG using "vibe coding" involves clearly defining tasks, selecting a well-supported tech stack, and adopting an iterative development approach that emphasizes refactoring and modularity. By breaking features into small, testable steps and leveraging AI-assisted coding tools, you can rapidly prototype core mechanics—such as the idle game loop and state persistence—before gradually layering on additional systems like upgrades, achievements, and UI components. Throughout development, maintain a clean architecture with small modules and clear APIs, employ version control and automated testing to safeguard against regressions, and continuously refactor to keep the codebase extensible for future features.

## **Step 1: Project Planning & Tool Selection**

1. **Define Clear, Detailed Prompts**

   * Craft prompts that precisely describe the functionality you want the AI to generate, avoiding ambiguity to minimize errors and rework.

   * Break high-level features into the smallest possible tasks (e.g., “Implement a timer that ticks every second” rather than “Create the idle loop”).

2. **Choose a Popular, Well-Documented Tech Stack**

   * Frontend: React or Vue with TypeScript for type safety and community support.

   * State Management: Redux or Zustand (React) / Pinia (Vue) for predictable state updates.

   * Styling: Tailwind CSS to rapidly build responsive UIs.

   * Hosting & Backend: Next.js (for API routes) \+ Vercel or Netlify, with Supabase or Firebase for real-time database and auth.

3. **Set Up Version Control & CI**

   * Initialize a Git repository and configure branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`, feature branches).

   * Integrate CI (GitHub Actions) to run linting, tests, and builds on each pull request.

---

## **Step 2: Architecting a Modular Codebase**

1. **Adopt a Folder Structure for Separation of Concerns**

   * `/components`: UI elements

   * `/systems`: game logic modules (idle loop, upgrade system, economy)

   * `/hooks` or `/composables`: reusable logic (timers, event queues)

   * `/utils`: helper functions and constants

   * `/tests`: unit and integration tests

2. **Encapsulate Features in Small Modules**

   * Each feature (e.g., clicker, auto-tick, inventory) lives in its own file with a clear API surface.

   * Follow SOLID principles—especially Single Responsibility—to ensure each module handles only one aspect of game logic.

3. **Define Interfaces and Types Early**

   * Use TypeScript interfaces for entities like `Player`, `Upgrade`, and `Resource`, making future expansions predictable and type-safe.

---

## **Step 3: Building the Core Idle Loop**

1. **Implement a Central Game Loop**

   * Use `requestAnimationFrame` or `setInterval` for the idle tick, decoupling render updates from logic updates.

   * In each tick, calculate resource gains, check upgrade unlocks, and update state.

2. **State Persistence**

   * Serialize game state to `localStorage` or IndexedDB at regular intervals and on unload events to preserve progress.

   * Abstract persistence logic into a service module for easy refactoring.

3. **Event Scheduling System**

   * Create an event queue for timed actions (e.g., automated income, cooldowns), allowing new event types to be plugged in without altering the core loop.

---

## **Step 4: Iterative Feature Implementation with Vibe Coding**

1. **AI-Assisted Step-by-Step Development**

   * Prompt the AI to “Implement the next smallest feature I can test” and review the output critically before merging.

   * After each merge, write or update unit tests to cover the new behavior, preventing regressions in future refactors.

2. **Versioned Integration Tests**

   * Automatically generate integration tests using AI prompts after major feature merges, ensuring end-to-end functionality remains intact.

3. **Peer Reviews & Security Checks**

   * Use GitHub’s code review features to have teammates or community members review AI-generated code for logic flaws and security vulnerabilities.

---

## **Step 5: Continuous Refactoring & Code Quality**

1. **Establish Linting and Formatting**

   * Configure ESLint with your style guide and Prettier for consistent code formatting. Trigger these tools in CI pipelines.

   * Use AI tools to suggest refactoring opportunities (“Extract this if block into its own function”), but validate suggestions manually.

2. **Refactor Regularly**

   * Every few sprints or feature additions, schedule a “cleanup sprint” to prune dead code, merge similar modules, and update interfaces.

   * Leverage IDE refactoring tools (e.g., VSCode’s “Rename Symbol”, “Extract Method”) to perform safe, automated changes.

3. **Documentation and Typings**

   * Maintain up-to-date README, inline JSDoc comments, and a living architecture diagram to onboard new developers quickly.

---

## **Step 6: Extensibility & Future-Proofing**

1. **Plugin or Module Registry**

   * Build a simple registry that discovers and initializes feature modules (e.g., `/plugins/achievements`, `/plugins/seasonal-events`) without altering core code.

2. **Data-Driven Configurations**

   * Store gameplay parameters (costs, multipliers, unlock thresholds) in JSON or a headless CMS. This allows non-developers to tweak balance without code changes.

3. **API Abstraction Layer**

   * If you later introduce multiplayer or cloud saves, encapsulate all external requests behind an API client, isolating network concerns from game logic.

---

## **Step 7: Deployment & Monitoring**

1. **Serverless Deployment**

   * Deploy static assets and serverless functions (for leaderboards or authentication) to Vercel or Netlify for zero-maintenance scaling.

2. **Performance Profiling**

   * Use browser dev tools and Lighthouse to audit CPU and memory usage, focusing on optimizing the idle loop and large data updates.

3. **Analytics & Telemetry**

   * Integrate analytics (e.g., Plausible, Google Analytics) to track retention, idle time, and feature engagement, guiding future enhancements.

---

## **Step 8: Maintenance & Iteration**

1. **User Feedback Loop**

   * Collect player feedback through in-game surveys or community channels to prioritize new features and balance tweaks.

2. **Regular Updates**

   * Schedule periodic content drops (new upgrades, seasonal events) using your plugin system, ensuring minimal core code changes.

3. **Community Contributions**

   * Open-source parts of your codebase or provide a modding API, inviting external contributors to add features in a controlled manner.

By following this structured, vibe-coding-infused roadmap—anchored by clear prompts, modular design, continuous refactoring, and AI-assisted development—you’ll build a maintainable, extensible browser-based idle RPG that can evolve gracefully as new ideas and community contributions emerge.
