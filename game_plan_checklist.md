# Project Plan Checklist: Basic Clicker Game (Modular)

**Goal:** Create a simple web-based clicker game with a modular code structure for easy updates and expansions.

**Files to be created:**

* [`index.html`](index.html): The main HTML file to structure the game interface.
* [`style.css`](style.css): A CSS file for basic styling.
* [`script.js`](script.js): The JavaScript file containing the game logic.

**Steps (Initial Clicker Game):**

* [x] 1.  **Project Setup:**
  * [x] Create the project directory (already done: `c:/Users/iman2/Desktop/Here We Go Again`).
  * [x] Create the three core files: [`index.html`](index.html), [`style.css`](style.css), and [`script.js`](script.js).

* [x] 2.  **HTML Structure (`index.html`):**
  * [x] Set up the basic HTML5 document structure.
  * [x] Link the [`style.css`](style.css) file in the `<head>`.
  * [x] Link the [`script.js`](script.js) file at the end of the `<body>`.
  * [x] Add elements for:
  * [x] Displaying the current score (e.g., a `<p>` or `<div>` with an ID).
  * [x] A button that the user will click to increase the score (e.g., a `<button>` with an ID).

* [x] 3.  **Basic CSS Styling (`style.css`):**
  * [x] Add some basic styles to make the game elements visible and centered (optional but improves presentation).

* [x] 4.  **JavaScript Structure and Modularity (`script.js`):**
  * [x] Define an object or use functions to encapsulate game state (like the score) and game logic.
  * [x] Use functions for specific actions like `incrementScore()`, `updateDisplay()`, etc.
  * [x] Ensure separation of concerns (e.g., game logic separate from UI updates).

* [x] 5.  **Core JavaScript Logic Implementation (`script.js`):**
  * [x] Inside the modular structure, declare a variable for the score, initialized to 0.
  * [x] Get references to the score display element and the click button.
  * [x] Implement the `incrementScore` function to update the score variable.
  * [x] Implement the `updateDisplay` function to show the current score on the page.
  * [x] Add an event listener to the click button that calls the appropriate function(s) (e.g., `incrementScore` and then `updateDisplay`).

* [x] 6.  **Testing the Core Mechanic:**
  * [x] Open [`index.html`](index.html) in a web browser.
  * [x] Verify that clicking the button increases the score displayed on the page.

**Optional Enhancements (Initial Clicker Game):**

* [x] 7.  **Add a Score Multiplier/Upgrade:**
  * [x] Add another button in [`index.html`](index.html) for purchasing an upgrade.
  * [x] Within the modular JavaScript structure, add a variable for a click multiplier (initialized to 1).
  * [x] Modify the score increment logic to add `1 * multiplier`.
  * [x] Add logic for the upgrade button, potentially in a dedicated function:
  * [x] Check if the player has enough score to buy the upgrade.
  * [x] If yes, decrease the score by the upgrade cost, increase the multiplier, and update the display.
  * [x] Add Passive Income:
  * [x] Within the modular JavaScript structure, use `setInterval` to periodically increase the score based on a passive income rate.
  * [x] Display the passive income rate in [`index.html`](index.html).

## Combined Game Development Plan Checklist: From Clicker to Idle RPG

**Goal:** Evolve the basic clicker game into a more comprehensive browser-based Idle RPG with modular code for easy expansion and maintenance.

**Steps for Expansion:**

* [x] 1.  **Review and Enhance Code Modularity:**
  * [x] Review the current `script.js` structure to ensure it aligns with the modular principles outlined in `Idle RPG Plan.md` (Step 2).
  * [x] Refactor existing code into smaller, more focused modules or objects if necessary to improve separation of concerns.

* [x] 2.  **Implement State Persistence:**
  * [x] Add functionality to save the current game state (score, multiplier, etc.) to the browser's `localStorage` or similar storage.
  * [x] Implement logic to load the saved game state when the page is loaded. (Based on `Idle RPG Plan.md` Step 3.2)

* [ ] 3.  **Expand Core Mechanics - Upgrades:**
  * [ ] Design and add new types of upgrades (e.g., upgrades that increase passive income rate, reduce upgrade costs, unlock new features).
  * [ ] Update the UI (`index.html`) to include buttons and displays for new upgrades.
  * [ ] Implement the logic for purchasing and applying these new upgrades in `script.js`, maintaining modularity. (Based on `game_plan.md` Step 7 and `Idle RPG Plan.md` Step 4)

* [ ] 4.  **Introduce New Resources/Currencies:**
  * [ ] Define additional resources or currencies beyond the main "score" (e.g., gems, materials, energy).
  * [ ] Update the game state and display to track these new resources.
  * [ ] Integrate new resources into existing or new mechanics (e.g., some upgrades might cost a different resource).

* [ ] 5.  **Develop Basic Inventory System:**
  * [ ] Create a system to manage items the player collects.
  * [ ] Add a simple UI section to display the inventory.
  * [ ] Implement logic for adding, removing, and potentially using items.

* [ ] 6.  **Implement Event Scheduling System:**
  * [ ] Develop a more robust system for handling timed events or actions, which can be expanded for future features like timed buffs, missions, or production cycles. (Based on `Idle RPG Plan.md` Step 3.3)

* [ ] 7.  **Add Achievements System:**
  * [ ] Define a set of achievements based on player progress (e.g., reaching a certain score, buying a specific number of upgrades).
  * [ ] Implement logic to track player actions and unlock achievements.
  * [ ] Add a UI section to display unlocked achievements.

* [ ] 8.  **Basic Combat/Exploration Mechanic (Simplified Idle):**
  * [ ] Introduce a simplified system where the player can send units on missions or engage in combat that resolves over time (idle combat).
  * [ ] Define unit types, stats, and mission parameters.
  * [ ] Implement the background simulation and display results to the player.
  * [ ] Refine UI and User Experience:
  * [ ] Improve the visual design using CSS.
  * [ ] Ensure the UI clearly displays all relevant information (score, resources, upgrades, passive income, etc.).
  * [ ] Add visual feedback for actions (e.g., score increasing on click).

* [ ] 10. **Continuous Testing and Refactoring:**
  * [ ] Regularly test new features as they are implemented.
  * [ ] Dedicate time to refactor code, improve readability, and ensure the modular structure is maintained as the project grows. (Based on `Idle RPG Plan.md` Step 5)

* [ ] 11. **Future Considerations (from Idle RPG Plan.md):**
  * [ ] Evaluate the need for a frontend framework (React/Vue) and TypeScript as the project complexity increases.
  * [ ] Plan for deployment and monitoring.
  * [ ] Consider implementing a plugin or module registry for greater extensibility.
